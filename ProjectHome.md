This is a port of Quake 1 for iPhone and iPod touch.  It is also compatible with the iPad.  This code was ported in October of 2008 and the youtube video became very popular (see below).  We recently got a couple requests to publish the code and so we dug it up, dusted it off, and published it here.  The original article about porting the Quake 1 engine appeared at http://www.tmsoft.com/article-iphone-quake.html and the youtube video showing its capabilities can be viewed here:

Kevin Arunski started the project by downloading the GLQuake source code from ID Software. He ported the graphics, sound, and networking.  Todd Moore joined in and implemented the user interface and player controls.

We hope you enjoy playing it!
